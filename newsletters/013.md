Most of the code is already open-source and can be obtained from repositories such as github.com/SOPHGO. The following are some useful repo resources:

### Linux kernel

+ Linux Official Community Upstream work:

  + Preliminary kernel support for Milk-V Pioneer/SG2042 has been [submitted to the SOC repository by kernel maintainer Conor][lk-1]. It is expected to enter the mainline after the merge window of version 6.7 is opened (about two to three weeks later) .
