## Editor's Note

Welcome to the ninety-fifth issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this edition, we celebrate a significant milestone—SG2044 has officially been merged into the Linux 6.16 mainline, once again receiving official support from Linux!

## Highlights

+ We are honored to announce that on May 31, 2025, SOPHGO's latest generation RISC-V server-grade processor, the SG2044, was merged into the Linux 6.16 mainline. Following the success of the SG2042, the SG2044 has once again received official support and maintenance from the Linux community, which reflects Linux's continued recognition and strong confidence in SOPHGO's RISC-V products. We sincerely thank Professor Hongjun Dai and his team from Shandong University, as well as all the outstanding open-source developers who tirelessly contribute to the prosperity of the RISC-V ecosystem.
