# SG2042 Newsletter (2023-08-04 #002)

## Editor's Note

Welcome to the second issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. This week we saw more cases of SG2042 applications. Communities including openEuler are using the powerful computing power of SG2042 to improve productivity. Another small and interesting product (milkv Duo) has also received a lot of updates.

## Highlights

+ The openEuler RISC-V SIG has connected the SG2042 (EVB) server board to the OERV OBS (Open Build Service) for system build testing since April 2023, and it has been basically running stably for many months, and has provided a 6-30 times build acceleration for various large package builds. With the release of Milk-V Pioneer, more and more high-performance RISC-V devices based on SG2042 will join the OERV build farm, aiming to provide RISC-V package build acceleration for various systems including openEuler, Debian, Deepin, and so on.

## Upstream

Most of the code is already open-source and can be obtained from repositories such as github.com/SOPHGO. The following are some useful repo resources:

### Linux kernel

https://github.com/sophgo/linux-riscv

+ txgbe driver supports wangxun 10GbE cards
+ SG2042 soc multiple drivers merge-in
+ Normal bugs fixing
+ Device tree configuration 
+ Kernel defconfig configuration 

### U-Boot

https://github.com/sophgo/u-boot/tree/sg2042-dev

+ CONFIG_NET_RANDOM_ETHADDR removed from defconfig  

### OpenSBI
