## Editor's Note

Welcome to the ninety-seventh issue of the SG2042 Newsletter. In this issue, we bring you progress on mainline kernel support for the CV18XX and SG2044 platforms.

## Highlights

+ Weâ€™re excited to share the latest upstream progress for CV18XX and SG2044 in the Linux kernel community. The CV18XX Reset driver has been updated to v4, and DMA-MUX is now scheduled for inclusion in Linux 6.17. Support for the Duo Module 01 EVB has reached v8. Meanwhile, SG2044 is advancing its PCIe and PWM drivers, along with corresponding device tree nodes, into the for-next stage.
